# Skills

Skills are the core building blocks of PancakeSwap AI. Each skill is a Markdown file (`SKILL.md`) with YAML frontmatter that tells an LLM agent exactly how to perform a task.

## All Skills

## Skill Anatomy

Every skill file follows the same structure:

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: When to activate this skill (trigger phrases)
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash(npm:*)
model: opus
license: MIT
metadata:
  author: pancakeswap
  version: '1.0.0'
---

# Skill Title

Content: decision guides, code templates, address tables,
validation rules, anti-patterns, and more.
```

### Frontmatter Fields

| Field              | Required | Description                                             |
| ------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`             | Yes      | Unique skill identifier                                 |
| `description`      | Yes      | Trigger phrases — when the agent should load this skill |
| `allowed-tools`    | Yes      | Tools the agent may use while executing this skill      |
| `model`            | No       | Recommended LLM model (opus, sonnet)                    |
| `license`          | No       | License for the skill content                           |
| `metadata.author`  | No       | Author name                                             |
| `metadata.version` | No       | Semantic version                                        |

## Design Principles

1. **Self-contained** — each skill has everything an agent needs (addresses, ABIs, code templates)
2. **Decision-first** — start with a decision guide so the agent picks the right approach
3. **Correct by default** — code templates use verified addresses and safe defaults
4. **Anti-pattern aware** — explicitly call out common mistakes with `::: danger` blocks
5. **Chain-aware** — tables map every address and behavior to specific chain IDs
6. **Testable** — each skill has a corresponding eval suite under `evals/suites/`
