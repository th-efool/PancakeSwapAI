## Quick Example

Ask your agent:

```
I have 500 CAKE and 2 BNB. What's the best farming strategy on PancakeSwap?
```

The agent reads the `farming-planner` skill, compares options (CAKE staking vs LP farming), and produces a plan:

```
## Farming Plan

**Option 1 — CAKE Staking (Lowest Risk)**
Stake CAKE in a Syrup Pool to earn partner tokens or more CAKE
Link: https://pancakeswap.finance/pools

**Option 2 — BNB-CAKE V3 Farm (Higher Yield)**
1. Add liquidity → https://pancakeswap.finance/add/BNB/0x0E09.../2500?chain=bsc
2. Stake in farm → https://pancakeswap.finance/liquidity/pools?chain=bsc

**Risks:** Impermanent loss if BNB/CAKE ratio shifts
```
